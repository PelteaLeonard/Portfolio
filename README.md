# Hello


 This is the portfolio  that  i've created  to make it easy for people to know who  I am and what I'm doing. Creating an online portfolio is one of the best ways to show off my best work, all in one place. Users can see my portfolio and if someone needs to build a website, an application or is interested in a collaboration on a cool project they can contact me.

## UX


My portfolio is a great way to demonstrate the compentencies I would list on my resume or to talk about in an interview. During a job search, the portfolio showcases my work to potential employers.

### User Stories



- As a user, I want to have the application respond quickly to my actions so that I don't get bored. 
- As a user, I want to see sensible and predictable URLs so that the application feels logical and transparent. 
- As a user, I want to be able to use Unicode so that I can use any language I like.  
- As a site visitor, I want to be able to get back to the home page quickly and easily, so I don’t get lost navigating
and so the site works like every other site in the world.
-As a visitor, I want to be able to view the site and videos in any reasonable browser so that I can use what I’m
accustomed to. 


### Wireframes


I drew my wireframes using Balsamiq. I have done two wireframes for each page to show my consideration of how to make my website responsive.

# Hello


 This is the portfolio  that  i've created  to make it easy for people to know who  I am and what I'm doing. Creating an online portfolio is one of the best ways to show off my best work, all in one place. Users can see my portfolio and if someone needs to build a website, an application or is interested in a collaboration on a cool project they can contact me.

## UX


My portfolio is a great way to demonstrate the compentencies I would list on my resume or to talk about in an interview. During a job search, the portfolio showcases my work to potential employers.

### User Stories



- As a user, I want to have the application respond quickly to my actions so that I don't get bored. 
- As a user, I want to see sensible and predictable URLs so that the application feels logical and transparent. 
- As a user, I want to be able to use Unicode so that I can use any language I like.  
- As a site visitor, I want to be able to get back to the home page quickly and easily, so I don’t get lost navigating
and so the site works like every other site in the world.
-As a visitor, I want to be able to view the site and videos in any reasonable browser so that I can use what I’m
accustomed to. 


### Wireframes


I drew my wireframes using Balsamiq. I have done two wireframes for each page to show my consideration of how to make my website responsive. The links to the files are below:

- [home.html (md-lg-and-xl)](https://github.com/PelteaLeonard/Portfolio/blob/master/static/wireframes/home(md-lg-and-xl).png)
- [home.html (sm)](https://github.com/PelteaLeonard/Portfolio/blob/master/static/wireframes/home(sm).png)
- [abou.htmlt (md-lga-md-xl](https://github.com/PelteaLeonard/Portfolio/blob/master/static/wireframes/about(md-lga-md-xl).png)
- [about.html (sm)](https://github.com/PelteaLeonard/Portfolio/blob/master/static/wireframes/about(sm).png)
- [portfolio.html (md-lg-and-xl)](https://github.com/PelteaLeonard/Portfolio/blob/master/static/wireframes/portfolio(md-lg-and-xl).png)
- [portfolio.html (sm)](https://github.com/PelteaLeonard/Portfolio/blob/master/static/wireframes/portfolio(sm).png)
- [contact.html (md-lg-and-xl](https://github.com/PelteaLeonard/Portfolio/blob/master/static/wireframes/contact(md-lg-and-xl).png)
- [contact.html (sm)](https://github.com/PelteaLeonard/Portfolio/blob/master/static/wireframes/contact(sm).png)

There are some differences between my wireframes and my final website.

#### Existing Features

**Home button** - Takes the user to the starting point of my portfolio.

**About button** - Takes the user to about section in my portfolio where I wrote something about me.

**Portfolio button** - Takes the user to portfolio section where is going to show all my projects that I've done till that moment.

**Contact button** - Takes the user to contact section where people  can contact me.

**Hamburger button** - Clicking the hamburger button triggers a full screen overlay menu containing the navigation links to all pages on my website.

#### Features left to implement

- **Hamburger button** - I will add some functionality to the hamburger buttons.

### Technologies Used
**Balsamiq** - I've used Balsamiq to create wireframes of my website before building the actual site.

**HTML5** - The project uses HTML5 to create the basic elements and content of my website.

**CSS3** - The project uses CSS3 to add custom styles to the elements and content of my website.

**Bootstrap** - The project uses Bootstrap to add a responsive grid system, prebuilt components, plugins built on jQuery, and Bootstrap styles to my website, before adding my custom styles.

**Git**  - I've used Git as a version control system to regularly add and commit changes made to project in Cloud9, before pushing them to GitHub.

**GitHub** - I've used GitHub as a remote repository to push and store the committed changes to my project from Git. I've also used GitHub pages to deploy my website in a live environment.


### Testing

#### Responsive Testing

- I used Google Chrome's Development tools to constantly test each change that I made to my website and to ensure that it appeared in the desired way on different screen sizes. I also tested my website on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet and desktop) to ensure it appeared in the desired way on different devices.
- To test my whole website, I went through each page, feature by feature, and documented the results on a spreadsheet. The spreadsheet also documents any responsive features and confirms that they work and appear as intended on different screen sizes. 

### HTMl and CSS Validation
- I used the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) to validate my HTMl code.
- i used the[W3c CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) to validate my CSS code.

### Deployment
The hosting platform that I've used for my project is GitHub Pages. To deploy my website to GitHub pages, I used the following steps:
Loaded the terminal window in my Cloud9 workspace.

Initialised Git using the git init command.

Added all files to the Staging area (Git) using the git add . command.

Committed the files to Git using the git commit -m "Initial commit" command.

Created a new repository in GitHub called 'monkees-milestone-project-one'.

Copied the below code from GitHub into the terminal window in my Cloud9 workspace:

git remote add origin https://github.com/PelteaLeonard/Portfolio.git

git push -u origin master

Entered my GitHub username and password to push the files from Git to GitHub.

Went into 'Settings' on my repository page in GitHub.

Selected the 'master branch' option under the 'GitHub Pages' section.

Ran several regular commits throughout my project.
